##Permisions
most modpacks require permisions from the author in order to include them in a pack. At the current point in time, I request that you private message me on either [minecraft forums](http://google.com) or on the [FTB Forums](http://google.com). most likely, it will be aproved, except under rare circumstances. please __DO NOT__ request permision to use an experamental build in a pack, it will be denied.
